Yo so i made the room for the puzzle 1, but i got real stuck with adding
dialog boxes. I have written the stuff for each puzzle thingy, hope yall can
add the text to it. The door animation is also not there or like post win but
the puzzle for room 1 itself works (aside from the weird dialog stuff).

Anyway yeah im tired now, maybe I will add another room after writing this,
maybe I won't. The idea of the puzzle is that on the right there's a cute
story about a bunny, but it's out of order. Based on the hints of the story
you gotta guess which bookshelves to hit on the left side of the screen. In
case you don't wanna go through it the answer is 3142.

Here is the text that goes with each bookshelf and the two typewriters.
The numbering starts from the top of the screen to the bottom
L = left
R = right
P = puzzle

Rummage the shelves on the left in the right order to find what you’re looking for. …What was the order again?

Did you hear about the story of the bunny? It’s my favorite!
P1BookR1
Once upon a time there was a singular bunny named Susy. She loved to sing and hop around everywhere she went.
P1BookR2
She had two large beautiful ears that could hear everything both near and far. She was nicknamed big-ears since her hearing was astounding.
P1BookR3
All of a sudden, Susy heard her three sisters making a commotion in the nest. “I wonder what they are up to?” she asks.
P1BookR4
 “Surprise!” said the bunnies, “Happy birthday big-ears!” That’s right, Susy turned 4 years old that day. How sweet of her sisters to plan her a surprise party, with carrot cake and all. Susy was jumping with joy! The end.
