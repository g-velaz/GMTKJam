Astronaut: Hey! Aw man, they took most of my ship...can’t have !$@& on the moon...

Alien: Greetings stranger

Astronaut: Who said that?

Alien: I did, limbed-one. I saw your ship crash from the stars. You were thrown from your ship and my people assumed you died. 

Astronaut: You all thought I was dead and then started looting my ship??????

Alien: You did not seem to need it any longer. And, in our defense, we like collecting things.

Astronaut: Things?

Alien: Yes, all kinds of things. We are very fascinated with human things in particular. We have an extensive collection. I even went out of my way to learn your language, and it was rather tricky. Your tongue twisters are most perplexing, especially considering the fact that we do not have tongues at all 

Astronaut: I don’t even know where to begin with all of this...

Alien: Well, I assume you want to get all the stolen parts of your ship back right? We’ll have to go into town and find them. 

Astronaut: Wait, “we”? You’re going to help me? I thought you liked collecting things? Wouldn’t you try to steal from me instead of helping me? 

Alien: I most certainly do like collecting things, but spaceship parts bear no interest to me. Maybe you can help me out once I help you get your ship back. A favor for a favor. Sounds like a fair deal, right?

Astronaut: Do I really have another choice?

Alien: You could refuse my help, but then you wouldn’t be able to understand anything my people say. You would be without a guide. 

Astronaut: Well, looks like we’re joined together now. 

Alien: First things first: we gotta get out of this place. You landed in a junkyard. I would take you back to town but I sort of lost my way… oops. I’ll follow you.
