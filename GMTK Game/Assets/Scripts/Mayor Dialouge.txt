Alien: This is our mayor, please notice his exquisite top hat. He stole it from Earth decades ago. Some poor chap named “Ab Ham Link On” 

Astronaut: Uh, hello mayor?

Mayor: *Alien sounds*

Astronaut: What did he say?

Alien: He said that you are absolutely horrifying. Your gangly limbs and obtuse head will likely haunt him for the rest of his days. Your grotesque figure is pure nightmare fuel. 

Astronaut: ...Neat…

Astronaut: Did he say anything about where my ship parts are?

Alien: Oh yea forgot about that...ahem... *Alien noises* 

Mayor: *Alien noises*

Alien: He said “Here, take this part I took, just please don’t hurt me or my family” ... And he also said that the rest of your parts are being kept in a safe, we'll have to break in if you want them back.

Astronaut: Wh-... He said all that? 

Alien: Yes

Astronaut: But...I don’t want to hurt them...

Alien: And he is very grateful for that

Astronaut: I just… Never mind, let’s go...
